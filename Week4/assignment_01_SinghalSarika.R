#Comparing and contrasting the point distributions between the two section, looking at both tendency and consistency: Can you say that one section tended to score more points than the other? Justify and explain your answer.

#Ans : Sports has more points than Regular the density at of the points at the higher scores is more in Sports graph.
#It feels like bimodial, peaks for the sections are different.

#Did every student in one section score more points than every student in the other section? If not, explain what a statistical tendency means in this context.

#yes looking the mean to see the central tendency sounds that way. 

#What could be one additional variable that was not mentioned in the narrative that could be influencing the point distributions between the two sections?  
#Prior knowledge could one more factor of consideration.
